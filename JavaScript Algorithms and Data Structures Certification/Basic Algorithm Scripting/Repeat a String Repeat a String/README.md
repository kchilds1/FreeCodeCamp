# Objective
Repeat a given string str (first argument) for num times (second argument). Return an empty string if num is not a positive number. For the purpose of this challenge, do not use the built-in .repeat() method.

## Steps
- Without using the repeat method, I created a new variable to store new string being returned.
- Created for loop to loop through num number of times
- Used += to concatenate str onto newString num number of times
- return the results of the for loop
