# Objective
Rewrite the function nonMutatingSplice by using slice instead of splice. It should limit the provided cities array to a length of 3, and return a new array with only the first three items.

Do not mutate the original array provided to the function.

## Steps
- Used the slice method to only have the first 3 strings that can be found in the inputCities variable. Then I had these strings set to a variable called locations and returned locations.
