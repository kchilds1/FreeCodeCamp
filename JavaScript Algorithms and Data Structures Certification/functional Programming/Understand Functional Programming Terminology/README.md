# Objective

Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC variables, respectively. Note that the getTea function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.

Note: The data (the number of cups of tea) is supplied as the last argument. We'll discuss this more in later lessons.

# Steps taken
- first call the function getTea() and we get two null values since tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC are set to null.
- console.log(getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27)) to make sure 13 cups of blackTea is being returned in the teaCups array.
- console.log(getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13)) to make sure 13 cups of blackTea is being returned in the teaCups array.
- set my console log values to constant variables tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC instead of null values.
