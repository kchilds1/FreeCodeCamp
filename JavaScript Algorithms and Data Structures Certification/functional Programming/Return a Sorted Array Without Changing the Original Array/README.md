# Objective
Use the sort method in the nonMutatingSort function to sort the elements of an array in ascending order. The function should return a new array, and not mutate the globalArray variable.

## Steps
- In the return I concatenated the nonMutatingSort parameter with an empty array so that I don't mutate the original array. The sort method is used with the comparison function to determine the order of the numbers.
