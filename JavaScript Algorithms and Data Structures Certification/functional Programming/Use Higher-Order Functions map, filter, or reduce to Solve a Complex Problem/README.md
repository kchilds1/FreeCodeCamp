# Objective
Complete the code for the squareList function using any combination of map(), filter(), and reduce(). The function should return a new array containing the squares of only the positive integers (decimal numbers are not integers) when an array of real numbers is passed to it. An example of an array of real numbers is [-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2].

Note: Your function should not use any kind of for or while loops or the forEach() function.

## Steps
- Added filter to returned value.  SquareList is being check to filter for numbers greater than 0 and number is a whole number divisible by 1 with no remainder.  The map function is used to return the square root of the filtered values.
