# Objective
Fill in the code for the function incrementer so it returns the value of the global variable fixedValue increased by one.

## Steps
- First I called the function with incrementer();
- Second I console.log(incrementer(fixedValue)) in order to see the results inside the freecodecamp console before running the tests.
- In the incrementer function to keep from changing the fixedValue, I return fixedValue + 1;
