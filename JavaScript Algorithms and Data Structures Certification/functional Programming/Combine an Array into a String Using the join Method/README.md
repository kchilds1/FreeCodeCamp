# Objective
Use the join method (among others) inside the sentensify function to make a sentence from the words in the string str. The function should return a string. For example, I-like-Star-Wars would be converted to I like Star Wars. For this challenge, do not use the replace method.

## Steps
- I returned a split of str using a shorthand character class \W delimiter. This will match all of the dashes for the split. Then I joined the stings to make one string using the join method.
